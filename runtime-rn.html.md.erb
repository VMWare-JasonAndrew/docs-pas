title: TAS for VMs v5.0 Release Notes
owner: Release Engineering 
---

This topic contains release notes for <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> is certified by the Cloud Foundry Foundation for 2023.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry Certified Provider Program, see [How Do I Become a Certified
Provider?](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms-how-to/) on the Cloud Foundry website.

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> containing that patch.

### <a id='4-0-0'></a> v4.0.0

**Release Date:** TBD

#### Known Issue

**WARNING**  

This version of TAS includes java-offline-buildpack version 4.52, that changes the default behavior of Spring Auto Reconfiguration.
This:
1: breaks TAS’s compatibility with some service tiles, including Spring Cloud Data Flow (SCDF)
2: breaks the service binding behavior of the platform for applications using this feature.

We consider this inclusion an operator-impacting disruptive change, and this disruption will be addressed in a fast-follow release as soon as practicable,
as required by our commitment to operational stability.This fast-follow release will likely arrive during the week of November 7th.

This issue doesn’t affect apps until they are re-staged.

It is possible to (temporarily) recover the previous behavior on a per app basis by setting an environment variable:

```
cf set-env example-appname JBP_CONFIG_SPRING_AUTO_RECONFIGURATION '{enabled: true}'
```

It can also be recovered platform wide:

```
cf set-staging-environment-variable-group '{"JBP_CONFIG_SPRING_AUTO_RECONFIGURATION ":"{enabled: true}"}'
```

VMware does intend to deprecate and remove this behavior from the platform in the future.

  **Important** pxc-release v1.0 is a major database upgrade from Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.7 to Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0
  **Version Bumps**
  - Bumped Percona XtraDB Cluster to 8.0.29-21
  - Bumped Percona XtraBackup to 8.0.29-22
  **New Features**
  - The database server default character set and collation have been changed to
  the Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0 default of utf8mb4 and utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
  respectively.
  The new defaults will only affect newly created databases created after
  pxc-release v1.0.1. For more information about the default database character
  set and collation see this MySQL documentation:
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-server.html
  The database server's default character set and collation may be configured
  explicitly via the pxc-mysql job's "engine_config.character_set_server" and
  "engine_config.collation_server" properties, respectively.
  - galera-agent and cluster-health logger users no longer need to be explicitly
  specified in the pxc-mysql job's seeded_users property.
  pxc-mysql will automatically generate these users when the galera-agent or
  cluster-health-logger jobs are deployed. This removes the breaking change
  from the previous release.
  - Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.7 packages are now included in deployments to aid in
  upgrades. In the previous release, only the Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0
  package was included on pxc/1.0 VMs.
  - Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0 packages have been renamed from
  "/var/vcap/packages/pxc" to "/var/vcap/packages/percona-xtradb-cluster-8.0"
  in an effort to distinguish from the percona-xtradb-cluster-5.7 package
  - In the previous release, upgrades from pxc-release prior to 1.0 running
  Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.7 where the v5.7 instance was not cleanly shutdown
  or had crashed would fail.
  As of pxc-release v1.0.1, the pxc-mysql job will run crash recovery with
  Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.7 prior to the upgrade to Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0
  - The "migrate-to-pxc" utility that previously assisted with migrations from
  cf-mysql-release are no longer included in this version of pxc-release
  **Breaking Changes**
  - If you previously relied on /var/vcap/packages/pxc in this release, the
  latest Percona XtraDB Cluster binaries are now located under
  /var/vcap/packages/percona-xtradb-cluster-8.0/bin
  Note that pxc-release always symlinks /usr/local/bin/mysql to the latest
  Percona XtraDB Cluster mysql cli for troubleshooting on the local VM.
  - Since v1.0, ubuntu-xenial is no longer supported! Only ubuntu-jammy or ubuntu-bionic stemcells can be used to deploy pxc-release v1.0.1

## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following major features:

### App syslog drains now support Mutual TLS and internal Certificate Authorities

Upgrading to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> opens up
more security options for application syslog drains. Syslog drains are now
compatible with syslog servers which:

* enforce client identity.
* have their own internal or domain-specific certificate authority.

Developers can configure their syslog drains to use Mutual TLS by specifying a
client certificate and private key. They can also configure their syslog drains
to communicate with syslog servers using internal or domain-specific
Certificate Authorities by specifying a CA. An example is provided below.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-user-provided-service DRAIN-NAME -l SYSLOG-URL -p {"cert":"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIH...-----END CERTIFICATE-----","key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIE...-----END PRIVATE KEY-----", "ca":"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIH...-----END CERTIFICATE-----"}
